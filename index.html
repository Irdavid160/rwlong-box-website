    <h2>The Box That Outlasts Cardboard</h2>
    <p>
      Our collapsible wooden box is stronger, longer-lasting, and more sustainable than traditional gaylords. Built to last 3+ years, repairable, and stackable at higher capacities—this box frees up space and lowers costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you’re storing bulk food, automotive parts, or even liquid products with liners, our system adapts to your needs. Tear down in seconds. Store without worry. And do it all for the cost of a coffee per day.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Built by craftsmen. Backed by experience. Ready to work for you.</strong></p>

  <h2>Why Our Box Is a Game Changer</h2>
  <ul style="list-style: square; padding-left: 20px;">
    <li><strong>Built to Outlast:</strong> Constructed from durable wood—not cardboard—our boxes last for years and withstand heavy industrial use.</li>
    <li><strong>Stack with Confidence:</strong> Unlike traditional gaylords, our boxes are safely stackable two or three high, even under heavy loads.</li>
    <li><strong>Collapsible Convenience:</strong> Set up and tear down in seconds. Store flat when empty. Save space. Save time.</li>
    <li><strong>Custom Sizes:</strong> From compact suitcase-style boxes to oversized bulk containers—we build to your exact specs.</li>
    <li><strong>Rent. Return. Reuse:</strong> Need temporary storage? Our rental option includes repairs and fast reshipment for seamless operations.</li>
    <li><strong>Better Value, Long-Term Savings:</strong> Comparable in cost to cardboard, but 100x the reuse—making it the smart, sustainable choice.</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Our mission is simple: Build better boxes, deliver better value, and support American industries with products that work as hard as you do.</strong></p>
